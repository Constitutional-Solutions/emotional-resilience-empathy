# Trauma Healing Protocol (Community-Oriented)

Content warning: This guide discusses trauma, crisis, and mental health. Adapt with cultural humility and seek professional support when needed.

## Purpose and Principles
- Safety, choice, collaboration, trust, and empowerment (core trauma-informed care principles)
- Culturally responsive, strengths-based, and consent-centered
- Do no harm: avoid forcing disclosure; honor boundaries; respect pace

## When To Use
- After distressing events, ongoing stress, or community crises
- As a guide for peer supporters, facilitators, and community organizers
- Not a substitute for professional therapy; provides stabilization and connection practices

## Protocol Overview
1) Stabilize and Orient
2) Assess Needs and Safety
3) Regulate and Resource
4) Connect and Support
5) Process and Integrate (when appropriate)
6) Plan, Refer, and Follow Up

## 1) Stabilize and Orient (First 5–15 minutes)
- Ensure physical safety and comfort (seating, water, warmth, privacy)
- Invite grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste
- Orient to time and place: today’s date, location, who is present, current safety
- Normalize reactions: “Your body is responding to stress; that’s understandable.”

Scripts:
- “You’re not alone. We can go slowly and only do what feels okay.”
- “Would you like to try a short grounding exercise together?”

## 2) Assess Needs and Safety
- Ask: “Are you safe right now? Is anyone else at risk?”
- Identify immediate needs: medical, shelter, food, childcare, transportation
- Determine consent for next steps; offer choices at every step
- If in imminent danger, contact emergency services with consent when possible

Safety Plan Elements:
- Triggers and early warning signs
- Coping actions and supports to contact
- Safe spaces and exit options
- Means safety (e.g., secure medications, remove lethal means)

## 3) Regulate and Resource
- Co-regulation: model slow breathing and calm voice
- Somatic practices: box breathing, 3–minute body scan, orienting gaze, paced exhale
- Sensory tools: cold water, weighted blanket, soothing scents, fidget object
- Cognitive tools: name emotion, label thoughts, compassionate self-talk
- Resource map: list 3 people, 3 places, 3 practices that help you feel safe

Practice Flow (5–10 minutes):
1. 4–6 breathing
2. Notice feet, seat, breath
3. Gentle stretch and yawn
4. Name one supportive thought

## 4) Connect and Support
- Listen without pressing for details; reflect feelings and needs
- Validate experience without analyzing or fixing
- Offer peer connection: support circles, faith groups, mutual aid, recovery groups
- Reduce isolation: schedule regular check-ins; pair with a buddy

Listening Prompts:
- “What would feel most supportive right now?”
- “Would you like me to sit with you, or help with logistics?”

## 5) Process and Integrate (When Appropriate)
- Only after stabilization; titrate exposure; stop if overwhelmed
- Externalize the story with choice: drawing, writing, movement, music
- Meaning-making: identify strengths, values, lessons
- Reclaim agency: choose one small, doable action

Boundaries:
- Avoid reliving or graphic detail
- Prioritize here-and-now safety and regulation
- Refer out for complex trauma, dissociation, or active risk

## 6) Plan, Refer, and Follow Up
- Create a brief written plan: next 24 hours, next week, supports, appointments
- Provide local resources and hotlines (see Ohio list below)
- With consent, schedule a check-in within 48–72 hours
- Document referrals provided and any safety steps taken

## Group/Circle Adaptation (60–90 minutes)
- Opening: land acknowledgment, group agreements, confidentiality limits
- Check-in round (1–2 minutes each)
- Grounding practice (5 minutes)
- Paired listening (see Guide: Peer Listening)
- Resource sharing and problem-solving
- Closing ritual: breathing, gratitude, next-steps

Suggested Agreements:
- Speak from the “I” perspective
- Step up/step back for equitable airtime
- No rescuing, fixing, or advice unless requested
- Confidentiality with mandatory reporting limits
- Consent before touch or follow-up contact

## Documentation Template
- Date/time, location, facilitator(s)
- Presenting issues (non-identifying)
- Interventions used (grounding, safety plan, referrals)
- Plan and follow-up date
